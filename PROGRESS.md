# School-OS progress log

## 2026-09-02 — initialization

- Repository confirmed: `jeremieguedj/School-OS` (private, default branch `main`).
- Frozen architecture baseline accepted for implementation.
- Deferred reviewer findings must be captured without altering the baseline.
- Phase 1 started: establish repository governance and reusable package skeleton.

## Resume instructions

1. Read `PLAN.md`.
2. Read this file from top to bottom.
3. Inspect the repository tree and the latest commit.
4. Continue only from the first unchecked task in the active phase.
5. Update this file after each verified milestone.


## 2026-09-02 — foundation and core-contract checkpoint

- Phase 1 complete: generic README, neutral entry points, architecture, privacy boundary, instruction-ownership map, development release manifest, and deferred adversarial-review record committed.
- Phase 2 in progress: created generic contracts for capabilities, source catalog, tasks, adapters, releases, fact-flag decisions, and initial logical schemas.
- Inspected the existing private system's generic instruction structure only; no personal catalog, task, or configuration content was copied into the repository.
- Next: add deterministic operations, private-instance templates, reference adapters, synthetic fixtures, and release/onboarding material.


## 2026-09-02 — reusable-package checkpoint complete

- Phases 1–5 are implemented at initial-package level: repository foundation; generic contracts/schemas; deterministic core operation recipes; private-instance templates; reference runtime/mail/task/scheduler/audio adapters; manual-install/update/migration documentation; and synthetic fixtures.
- Deferred reviewer findings and recommendations are recorded in `docs/deferred-adversarial-review.md` and were not incorporated into the frozen baseline.
- QA passed: all six JSON schemas parsed successfully; required entry, operation, adapter, template, fixture, plan, progress, and deferred-review files were read back from GitHub; targeted scan found no private family names, school domains, recipient address, or sampled live Drive IDs.
- No private Drive files, schedules, provider objects, or emails were modified during repository extraction.
- Next phase: private-instance inventory and configuration mapping under `docs/current-instance-migration.md`. This requires separate inspection/approval because it touches the live private deployment. Do not enable a new scheduler or release a public installer before that phase is validated.
